# EXTRACTING LOGICAL ROUTES OVER THE WIKIPEDIA GRAPH TO FACILITATE QUESTION ANSWERING

Question Answering a task in NLP that takes input as a questions of different types and outputs answers for these questions. The questions can be of various types such as Open domain vs closed domain. In open domain, factual and non-factual etc., The answers can also be of different types such as one word answers, selecting answers from a text inputted, yes or no questions, etc.  The open domain question answering has two parts. The first part is the Retriever module that gets documents from the web to answer the questions. The reader module is then used to answer the questions based on the retrieved documents. Both of the these tasks have to be trained.
